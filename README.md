# Polybar-kwm

Polybar-kwm is an [Übersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht) widget that tries to recreate the same behavior as [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) on macOS for [kwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm)


## Modules

- Workspaces
  - with highlight of current active space
- Volume
- CPU Usage
- Disk Usage
- Current Connected Wifi
- Battery
- Date
- Time


## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CaptnBlubber/Polybar-kwm.git ~/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/polybar
```

Download (or clone) this repository and place the contents inside a folder called `polybar` in your Übersicht widgets directory. By default the widget folder is located here: `~/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets`

## Prerequisites

This Widget uses SauceCodePro from [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). You can easily install them using [brew](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts):
```bash
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-sourcecodepro-nerd-font
```

## Configuration
The Bar will display where the macOS default menu bar is located. Therefore you have to configure the bar to hide itself:
System Preferences -> General -> Automatically hide and show the menu bar

Make sure your namespaces are named in kwm. Example:
``` 
kwmc config space 0 1 name " Web"
kwmc config space 0 2 name " Chat"
kwmc config space 0 3 name " Code"
```
Additionally I recommend to set a top spacing in kwm. My configuration:
```
kwmc config padding 32 8 8 8
```

## TODO
- [ ] Now Playing
- [ ] [chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm). Not sure yet if I will let this support both wm's or create a seperate Widget for it.


## Known Issues

After reboot all Spaces will be shown as *[no tag]*. This is due to how kwm currently works. Simply switch to every space once and kwm will have the proper names.
